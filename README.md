# Genetic Algorithm Playground

This repository contains solutions to code excercises of the book [An Introduction to Genetic Algorithms](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-genetic-algorithms) by [Melanie Mitchell](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~mm/). To submit your solution create a folder with your slack username and add your solution to that folder and submit it by making a PR. Create a WIP PR so that others may review your code as you work on it.
